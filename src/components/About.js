Rehem stands strong on the shoulders of two pillars Ms. Prabhuti and Mr. Akash

<u>How can you as a responsible human contribute</u><br/>
As a responsible human, you can feed a stray everyday. Educate others politely when they’re hurting an animal. During summers, provide them water in the mud bowls and during winters, provide them warm blankets to sleep upon. In return you’ll get their love and a wagging tale
